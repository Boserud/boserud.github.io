    <h2>My Summer Trip</h2>
    <p>I would not call myself a traveler. I have been to different place across the country, but most of my trips have been to the same cities.
        When I was in marching band, I was luck enough to travel to some away games and to championship games. As a child, I would travel to Orlando every year
	      to visit the parks. This past summer, I took a trip with my dad and brother. This trip was nice because I visited some new cities and cool places with family.
	      Check out some of the places I saw!
