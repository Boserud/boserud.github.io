    <p>I used to think that calling my musical abilities a "hobby" brought my studies down. I spent 12 years playing, practicing, and thought that to call that a hobby was almost like forgetting the hard work I put into my craft. But hobbies don't have to be something you do for fun. Many people work very hard on their hobbies, some as much as my "work". After spending the better part of three years transitioning out of music education, I consider my music to be a hobby as I am no longer playing for a grade or to impress someone. I simply play for the enjoyment of playing, and my years of training and work have allowed me to explore music more deeply!</p>
