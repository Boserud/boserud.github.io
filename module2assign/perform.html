      <h2>Practice</h2>
      <p>In the "performance hierarchy" you are always performing, but the audience is always different. When you practice, the audience is you alone. This is where you will make the most mistakes, but also the most progress.</p>
      <h2>Rehearsal</h2>
      <p>The audience in this stage are your directors and fellow musicians. Everyone will adjust and guide each other to work together, This is where <b>Harmony</b> is made.</p>
      <h2>Performance</h2>
      <p>At the highest point, the audience will be the people who are... in the audience! These listeners have made an effort to see the group play. At this point, there no more mulligans and redoes. Whatever sounds come from the group will create the music that everyone can enjoy. </p>
